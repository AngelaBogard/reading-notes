# About Me
Hello my name is Angela Bogard. I am currently a paraeducator at an elementary school. I went to RIT/NTID for Graphic Design Production and got my degree in 2015. Then went back to school at Kirkwood for welding and worked for a welder company for a year and got laid off due to COVID. The computer I am using is Macbook Air version 10.15.6. The reason why I am taking this class is to learn more about coding. I am deaf and am very visual which I feel will be a strength in the field of coding. I hope this will be a great career path for me!
