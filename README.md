# About Me
Hello! My name is *Angela Bogard*. I am currently a paraeducator at an elementary school. I went to RIT/NTID for Graphic Design Production and got my degree in 2015. Then went back to school at Kirkwood for welding and worked for a welder company for a year and got laid off due to COVID. The reason why I am taking this class is to learn more about coding. I hope this will be a great career path for me!
