# Expressions and Operators

An *operator* is a symbol that tells the compiler to perform specific mathematical or logical manipulations. 
R language is rich in built-in operators and provides following types of operators.
> An expression is a combination of one or more operands, zero or more operators, and zero or more pairs of parentheses.

There are *three* kinds of expressions:

- An arithmetic expression evaluates to a single arithmetic value.
- A character expression evaluates to a single value of type character.
- A logical or relational expression evaluates to a single logical value.
> The operators indicate what action or operation to perform.

## Loops

There are many different kinds of loops, but they all essentially do the same thing: 
they repeat an action some number of times.


A "For" Loop is used to repeat a specific block of code a known number of times. For example, if we want to check the grade of every student in the class, we loop from 1 to that number. When the number of times is not known before hand, we use a "While" loop.

A for loop repeats until a specified condition evaluates to false. 
The JavaScript for loop is similar to the Java and C for loop.

`for ([initialExpression]; [conditionExpression]; [incrementExpression])
  statement`

`for (let step = 0; step < 5; step++) {
  // Runs 5 times, with values of step 0 through 4.
  console.log('Walking east one step');
}`

A *while* statement executes its statements as long as a specified condition evaluates to true. 
A while statement looks as follows:

While loops are loops that will continue to go until a condition is no longer true. 
The reason they are called while loops because the code will repeat while a condition is still true. 
You can think of while loops as telling your app “while this happens, repeat this” or “while this hasn’t changed, repeat this”.

`while (condition)
  statement`
