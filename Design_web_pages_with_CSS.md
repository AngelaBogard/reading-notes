# What is CSS?

> **Cascading Style Sheets** allows you to create great-looking web pages.

Using CSS you can control exactly how HTML elements look in the browser, presenting your markup using whatever design you like.
CSS is a rule-based language. you define rules specifying groups of styles that should be applied to particular elements or groups of elements on your web page.


>  CSS can be used for very basic document text styling â€” for example changing the color and size of headings and links.


`h1 {
    color: red;
    font-size: 5em;
}`

- Here is the link for more color values: [ColorValues](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/Values_and_units#color)



The rule opens with a selector . This selects the HTML element that we are going to style. In this case we are styling level one headings `<h1>`

## Adding CSS to our document

- The very first thing we need to do is to tell the HTML document that we have some CSS rules we want it to use. 
There are *three* different ways to apply CSS to an HTML document, but for now linking CSS from the head of your document.

- Create a file in the same folder as your HTML document and save it as styles.css. The .css extension shows that this is a CSS file.

To link styles.css to index.html add the following line somewhere inside the <head> of the HTML document:
`<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">`
  
This `<link>` element tells the browser that we have a stylesheet, using the rel attribute, and the location of that stylesheet as the value of the href attribute. 
  You can test that the CSS works by adding a rule to styles.css. 
  `h1 {
  color: red;
}`
 > Save your HTML and CSS files and reload the page in a web browser. The level one heading at the top of the document should now be red.
