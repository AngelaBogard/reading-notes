# **Coder's Computer Notes**

> A `text editor` is a piece of software that you download and install on
your computer, or you access online through your web browser, that
allows you to write and manage text, especially the text that you write
to build a web site.


> `Syntax highlighting` is a feature that takes the text you
type, and makes it more noticeable by colorizing the text.


> Usually, web developers use a dark background and
brightly colored text. This combination seems to be easier on the eyes
but there are other themes to choose from as well.


# What other software can you use to edit?

- Notepad++
- Text Wrangler
- BB Edit
- Visual Studio Code

# Cheat Sheet...

- `pwd` is Print Working Directory..Where are we currently.
- `ls` means List the contents of a directory.
- `cd` is Change Directories...move to another directory.
- `file` is obtain information about what type of file a file or directory is.
- `ls -a` is List the contents of a directory, including hidden files.
- `tilde` is a shortcut for your home directory. eg, 
if your home directory is /home/ryan then you could refer to the directory Documents with the path /home/ryan/Documents or ~/Documents
- `dot` is a reference to your current directory. 
eg in the example above we referred to Documents on line 4 with a relative path. It could also be written as ./Documents (Normally this extra bit is not required but in later sections we will see where it comes in handy).
- `dotdot` is a reference to the parent directory. 
You can use this several times in a path to keep going up the hierarchy. eg 
if you were in the path /home/ryan you could run the command ls ../../ and this would do a listing of the root directory.

- `Relative path`
A file or directory location relative to where we currently are in the file system.
- `Absolute path`
A file or directory location in relation to the root of the file system.
